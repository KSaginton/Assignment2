    <div class="container">
      <h1>Global Rating Map Visualisation</h1>
      <div id="vis"></div>
      <script>
           var vg_1 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KSaginton/Assignment2/main/global_rating_map.json"; 
           vegaEmbed("#vis", vg_1).then(function(result) {
           }).catch(console.error);
      </script>
    </div>
      <h1>Candlestick Chart - EURUSD</h1>
      <div class="container-c">
        <div id="vis2" class = "candleStick"></div>
        <p>The EUR/USD currency pair is one of the most traded currency pairs in the world. The relationship between the Euro (EUR) and the US Dollar (USD) represents a blend of economic factors, including interest rate differentials, geopolitical events, and economic data releases from both the Eurozone and the United States. The fluctuations seen in the graph could be attributed to major economic announcements, policy changes from central banks, or significant global events impacting either the Eurozone or the US economy.</p>
      </div>
      <script>
           var vg_2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KSaginton/Assignment2/main/candle_EUR.json"; 
           vegaEmbed("#vis2", vg_2).then(function(result) {
           }).catch(console.error);
      </script>
    <h1>Candlestick Chart - AUDUSD</h1>
    <div class="container-c">
      <div id="vis3" class = "candleStick"></div>
      <p>The AUD/USD currency pair depicts the relationship between the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the US Dollar (USD). The Australian Dollar is often considered a commodity currency due to Australia's substantial raw material exports. Therefore, this pair can be influenced by the price of commodities such as iron ore, coal, and gold. Variations in the graph can also reflect economic data releases from Australia, changes in interest rates, as well as global economic and geopolitical events.</p>
    </div> 
    <script>
         var vg_3 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KSaginton/Assignment2/main/candle_AUD.json"; 
         vegaEmbed("#vis3", vg_3).then(function(result) {
         }).catch(console.error);
    </script>
    <h1>Candlestick Chart - USDCHF</h1>
    <div class="container-c">
      <div id="vis4" class = "candleStick"></div>
      <p>The USD/CHF currency pair represents the relationship between the US Dollar (USD) and the Swiss Franc (CHF). The Swiss Franc is often viewed as a "safe-haven" currency due to Switzerland's stable economy, banking system, and political neutrality. Therefore, during times of global economic uncertainty, the Swiss Franc may appreciate. The movements in the graph can be influenced by Swiss banking policies, interest rate changes, and major economic announcements from both the US and Switzerland.</p>
    </div>
    <script>
         var vg_4 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KSaginton/Assignment2/main/candle_CHF.json"; 
         vegaEmbed("#vis4", vg_4).then(function(result) {
         }).catch(console.error);
    </script>
    
    <h1>Candlestick Chart - USDCAD</h1>
    <div class="container-c">
      <div id="vis5" class = "candleStick"></div>
      <p>The CAD, commonly known as the "loonie," represents the Canadian Dollar, and it's among the top seven most traded currencies in the world. Often, the CAD is influenced by its relationship with the U.S., given the extensive trade between the two nations. Additionally, Canada's vast natural resources, especially oil, drive its currency's value. Thus, the CAD often correlates with oil prices. A rise in oil prices can lead to a strengthening of the CAD, considering Canada's substantial oil exports.</p>
    </div> 
    <script>
         var vg_5 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KSaginton/Assignment2/main/candle_CAD.json"; 
         vegaEmbed("#vis5", vg_5).then(function(result) {
         }).catch(console.error);
    </script>
    <h1>Candlestick Chart - USDJPY</h1>
    <div class="container-c">
      <div id="vis6" class = "candleStick"></div>
      <p>The JPY is the official currency of Japan and is known for its status as a safe-haven currency. Investors and traders often flock to the yen in times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical tensions. Japan's unique position as a country with a significant trade surplus and its status as the world's third-largest economy makes the JPY influential in forex markets. Additionally, Japan's historically low-interest rates have made the yen a popular choice in carry trade strategies, where traders borrow in a currency with low-interest rates and invest in a currency with higher interest rates.</p>
    </div>
    <script>
         var vg_6 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KSaginton/Assignment2/main/candle_JPY.json"; 
         vegaEmbed("#vis6", vg_6).then(function(result) {
         }).catch(console.error);
    </script>
    <h1>Circle Plot Graph on the Performance</h1>
    <div class="container-c">
      <div id="vis11"></div>
      <p>The Circle Plot suggests the peformance of the currencies compared to the USD currency. For several attributes where the peformance shows negative, there is no area shown within the circle plot suggesting their performance.</p>
    </div>  
    <script>
          var vg_11 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KSaginton/Assignment2/main/circle_plot.json";
